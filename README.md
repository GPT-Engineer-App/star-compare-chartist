# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: star-compare-chartist 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/f1418164-bf78-4912-91cb-0ab8b7b27081/improve

**Description**: Create a Node.js web app that has only one page hosted on localhost:3000. The page should have 2 input fields and a place where a chart will be plotted. When the user opens the page, they should paste 2 links to public repositories in each of the input fields. If the repository is not public, show that error message. Then, by clicking on a button, the links should be sent to the backend where the Node.js app should fetch historic Github stars for each of the repos pasted in the input fields. Make sure to use authenticated Github API so that you can get historic data and not only current number of Github stars. Github API token should be stored in .env and loaded on the server. After the star data is fetched, it should be saved into the mongodb database so we don't need to fetch it each time a user enters the same Github repos. When accessing the database use "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost". Finally, the star data should be sent to the frontend and shown on the chart. Data for both repos should be shown on the same chart so they can be compared one to another. Use line charts and make sure that the chart can be zoomed in and out. Users should be able to register, login and logout to website and they can use website functionality only after they are logged in.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
